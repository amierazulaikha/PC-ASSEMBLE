## What I Have Gained 🧠💡

During the PC assembly activity, I had the invaluable opportunity to enhance my understanding of how a computer functions. This hands-on experience was particularly enriching as I started with little knowledge about PCs but gained a comprehensive understanding of placing crucial components such as the CPU, RAM, motherboard, and more in their respective positions. Each part plays a distinct role, and this challenge taught me to handle them with utmost care.

Moreover, the experience emphasized the importance of teamwork. Collaborating with others allowed us to pool our knowledge and skills, making the entire assembly process more efficient.

## Suggestions for Improvement 🔄📈

From my perspective, I believe that providing videos or any information about a pre-lab demo before the actual lab session is highly beneficial. This approach offers students a preview of the upcoming practical activities, allowing them to familiarize themselves with the procedures and techniques in advance.

## Personal Reflections and Ideas 💭✨

PC assembly often involves problem-solving, such as identifying compatibility issues or troubleshooting hardware problems. Reflecting on these challenges encourages students to think critically and develop effective troubleshooting skills. This is a valuable aspect of the learning process as it simulates real-world scenarios in the field of computer hardware.
